# Claude Usage Monitor

Monitor your Claude.ai chat usage directly in VS Code. This extension uses direct API access (with intelligent fallback to web scraping) to fetch your current usage percentage and reset time from Claude.ai.

## Features

- **Direct API Access** ðŸš€: Fast, reliable data retrieval using Claude.ai's internal API
  - 2-3x faster than traditional web scraping
  - More reliable (JSON parsing vs HTML regex)
  - Intelligent fallback to HTML scraping if API fails
  - No breaking changes when Claude.ai updates their UI
- **Dual Usage Monitoring**: Track both Claude.ai usage AND development session token usage
  - Claude.ai 5-hour and 7-day usage percentages
  - Current session token count (from `session-data.json`)
  - Automatically updated when developing with Claude Code (see [SESSION_TRACKING.md](SESSION_TRACKING.md))
- **Enhanced Usage Metrics**: Separate tracking for different time windows
  - 5-hour usage limit with reset time
  - 7-day rolling usage with weekly reset
  - Color-coded indicators for both metrics
- **Status Bar Integration**: See both percentages at a glance (e.g., "Claude: 45% | Tokens: 26%")
- **Tree View Panel**: Detailed usage information in a dedicated side panel
- **Fixed 5-Minute Refresh**: Simple, reliable refresh every 5 minutes
- **Usage Level Indicator**: Shows how much "Claude time" remains (Idle/Light/Moderate/Heavy)
  - Based on max of Claude.ai usage % or session token %
  - Idle (0-24%): Plenty of Claude time! | Light (25-49%): Quarter+ used
  - Moderate (50-79%): Much work, many thought | Heavy (80-100%): Running low!
- **Auto-Start**: Fetches usage data automatically when VS Code starts
- **Silent Mode**: Runs browser in headless (hidden) mode, shows window only if login needed
- **Session Persistence**: Log in once, stay authenticated across VS Code sessions
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded warnings when approaching usage limits

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- VS Code 1.80.0 or higher
- Node.js installed (for Puppeteer/Chromium)

### Install from VSIX

1. Download the `.vsix` file
2. Open VS Code
3. Go to Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
4. Click the `...` menu at the top
5. Select "Install from VSIX..."
6. Choose the downloaded file

## First-Time Setup

The extension will **automatically fetch usage data** when VS Code starts. If you haven't logged in before:

1. A browser window will appear (the extension detected you need to log in)
2. Log in to Claude.ai with your credentials (Google, email, etc.)
3. Once logged in, the extension automatically fetches your usage data
4. Your session is saved locally - you won't need to log in again!
5. Future fetches run **silently in the background** (no browser window)

**That's it!** The extension will now:
- Fetch usage automatically on startup
- Refresh every 5 minutes (configurable)
- Display both Claude.ai and session token usage
- Show your coding activity level
- Run completely hidden unless login is required

## Usage

### Fetch Usage Data

There are several ways to fetch your usage data:

1. **Click the status bar item** (right side of VS Code)
2. **Use Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`):
   - Search for "Fetch Claude Usage Now"
3. **View the Activity Bar panel**:
   - Click the Claude Usage icon in the Activity Bar (left sidebar)
   - View detailed usage information

### View Usage Information

- **Status Bar**: Shows current usage percentage with a color-coded icon
  - Green check: < 80% usage
  - Orange warning: 80-89% usage
  - Red error: â‰¥ 90% usage
  - **Hover tooltip** shows:
    - Usage percentage
    - Reset time
    - Last update timestamp
    - **Activity level and next refresh interval** (e.g., "Heavy (5 min refresh)")

- **Tree View Panel**: Shows detailed information:
  - Usage percentage
  - Time until reset
  - Last update timestamp

## Configuration

Open VS Code Settings and search for "Claude Usage" to configure:

### `claudeUsage.fetchOnStartup`
- **Type**: Boolean
- **Default**: `true` âœ…
- **Description**: Automatically fetch usage data when VS Code starts

### `claudeUsage.headless`
- **Type**: Boolean
- **Default**: `true` âœ…
- **Description**: Run browser in headless (hidden) mode. Browser will show automatically if login is needed.

### `claudeUsage.activityBasedRefresh` ðŸ†•
- **Type**: Boolean
- **Default**: `true` âœ…
- **Description**: Automatically adjust refresh rate based on coding activity (5-60 minutes). Disable to use fixed interval.

### `claudeUsage.autoRefreshMinutes`
- **Type**: Number
- **Default**: `15`
- **Description**: Fixed auto-refresh interval in minutes (only used when Activity-Based Refresh is disabled)

**Recommended Configuration** (`settings.json`):
```json
{
  "claudeUsage.fetchOnStartup": true,
  "claudeUsage.headless": true,
  "claudeUsage.activityBasedRefresh": true
}
```

**For Fixed Interval Instead** (`settings.json`):
```json
{
  "claudeUsage.fetchOnStartup": true,
  "claudeUsage.headless": true,
  "claudeUsage.activityBasedRefresh": false,
  "claudeUsage.autoRefreshMinutes": 30
}
```

## Commands

All commands are available via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`):

- **`Claude: Fetch Claude Usage Now`** - Manually fetch current usage data
- **`Claude: Open Claude Settings Page`** - Open claude.ai/settings in your default browser

## How It Works

### Smart Activity Detection
The extension monitors your VS Code activity to optimize refresh timing:
- Tracks text edits, file saves, and editor changes
- Calculates activity level every 15 minutes
- Adjusts refresh rate automatically:
  - **Heavy coding**: 5-minute intervals
  - **Moderate work**: 15-minute intervals
  - **Light activity**: 30-minute intervals
  - **Idle/break**: 60-minute intervals

### Headless Browser Operation
1. The extension uses Puppeteer to launch a Chromium browser
2. On first run, it detects you need to log in (no session cookies found)
3. Browser launches in **visible mode** so you can log in manually
4. Your session is saved to `~/.claude-browser-session/` for future use
5. Subsequent fetches launch browser in **headless mode** (completely hidden)
6. The extension navigates directly to `https://claude.ai/settings/usage`
7. Usage data is extracted from the page and displayed in VS Code
8. Browser closes automatically to save resources

### Session Persistence
- Session cookies are stored locally by Chromium
- No credentials are stored by the extension
- Sessions typically last several weeks before expiring
- If session expires, browser will show again for re-login

## Privacy & Security

- **No credentials stored**: The extension never stores or transmits your credentials
- **Local session only**: Your authentication session is saved locally by Chromium
- **No data transmission**: Usage data stays on your machine
- **Open source**: All code is available for review

## Troubleshooting

### Browser won't launch

**Problem**: Error message "Failed to launch browser"

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you have enough disk space (~500MB for Chromium)
- Check that no antivirus is blocking Puppeteer
- Try running VS Code as administrator (Windows)

### Login timeout

**Problem**: "Login timeout" error after 5 minutes

**Solutions**:
- Complete the login process more quickly
- Check your internet connection
- Try again - the browser window should still be open

### Session expired

**Problem**: Browser keeps asking you to log in

**Solutions**:
- Delete the session folder: `~/.claude-browser-session/`
- Log in again - session should persist this time
- Make sure `headless` mode is `false` during login

### Can't find usage data

**Problem**: "Could not find usage percentage" error

**Solutions**:
- Claude.ai may have changed their settings page layout
- Check if you can see your usage at [claude.ai/settings](https://claude.ai/settings)
- Report an issue for the extension to be updated

### Performance issues

**Problem**: Browser uses too much memory

**Solutions**:
- `headless` mode is enabled by default - browser runs hidden
- Activity-based refresh automatically reduces frequency when idle
- The browser closes automatically after fetching to save memory
- If using fixed interval, increase `autoRefreshMinutes` to reduce frequency

## Known Limitations

- Requires Chromium to be downloaded by Puppeteer (~150-200MB)
- Fetch time: 2-10 seconds depending on network speed
- If Claude.ai changes their settings page, the extension may need updates
- Sessions can expire (typically after several weeks of inactivity)
